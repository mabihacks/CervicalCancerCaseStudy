# CervicalCancerCaseStudy
Cancer is one of the hardest to treat ailments of humanity. According to the Canadian Cancer Society, in 2019 1.3% of 107,400 new cases of cancer in women were cases of cervical cancer. The cervix is the opening of the uterus and its health is crucial to the reproductive system’s function. The area is home to a large number of blood vessels and lymphatic channels which can increase the risk of spread. In order to construct the most effective treatment plan we must understand the contributing factors and risks (Canadian Cancer Society, n.d).
The data in question has been gathered in Toronto from about 1984 to present and covers 905 cervical cancer patients. The researches recorded the following values:
MRNO: Patient number
SURGDAT: Date of surgery/Date of diagnosis (used interchangeably)
AGE: Age
CLS: Capillary Lymphatic Spaces - presence of tumor cells inside of the capillary lumens of either the lymphatic or microvascular drainage systems within the primary tumor (Chen, M., Jin, Y., Bi, Y., Li, Y., Shan, Y., & Pan, L., 2015)
DIS_STA: Disease Status – whether the patient is dead of complications (disease present/absent) or unrelated causes, alive with disease or without.
GRAD: Grade of cell differentiation – how much do the cancer cells differ from healthy cells.
HISTOLOG: Type of cancer
MARGINS: Disease left after primary surgery – none, in the para-vaginal area, vaginal area or both.
MAXDEPT: Depth of tumor (mm)
PELLYMPH: Pelvis lymph node involvement
RECURRN: Date of recurrence of disease
SIZE: Size of tumor
FU_DATE: Last follow up date
The main goal is to determine which of the factors above affect the probability of relapse of the disease and to classify the patients by individual risk of relapse.
